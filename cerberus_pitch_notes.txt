- Im a copyright lawyer who defends a lot of creative individuals that get their content taken and reposted online
- It's difficult to keep track of what websites take my client's content and whether they continue to do so after receiving cease and desist letters
- I need 2 interns to keep track of all the various infringements and check websites periodically that have infringed in the past
- I also need a way to verify the validity of accusation because screenshots are not trusted in court
- I have just found Cerberus that can handle all of this for me. (*** its a case management system that can take authenticated screenshots of infringing websites.
- Like any good lawyer, I made my intern set it up for me and today so I'm going to check it out.


Cases#Index:
- My first impression of the main cases page is that it is clear and organized: I can see all of the cases I have open with the various clients that I have.
- I can conveniently see important information like the number of infringing websites and how many total screenshots each case has.
- This Active Monitor feature seems great, I'm excited to see how that works.
- I'll open up one of these cases and to see how it's organized.
- This one has actually been a huge pain for me, my client ______ keeps having graphics taken another artist on instagram.


Case#show:
- Wow this is great, the case has all the information I need to keep track of - title, legal number (?), date and description.
- ...and it has all the infringing sites listed below with thumbnails and information.
- I'm going to open one of these up.


Case#infringement:
- Great, I can see all of the screenshots displayed over time.
- I also see that I can take a single screenshot with these buttons on the side, or set the timer to take screenshots at whatever interval I want.
- This website is taking graphics all the time so I'm going to change the interval to daily.
- ...and now I'm going to actually check out the screenshot.

Screenshot:
- Looks good to me, also handy to have the print and export features for when I need to share the infringements.
- ...and going back I see that I can export an entire folder of all my website screenshots.
- This is great, but now I actually need to add a new infringing page because this client said that their content is being illegally used on another part of the infringing website.
